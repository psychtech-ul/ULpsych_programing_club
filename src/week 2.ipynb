    "Welcome back to week 2 of python for SPSS users. Thank you for joining us again. This week we're going to start actually doing things in python, learning about functions, methods, and loops. But first...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lets recap!\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we learned about 3 basic python datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Strings: This is the datatype for written language. You make one by simply enclosing text (alphanumberic caracters and punctuation) in either apostrophies or double quotes (depending on whats in the text)\n",
    " 2. Ints: This is the datatype fot whole numbers, like 4, 230000, -1 etc. \n",
    " 3. Floats: This is the datatype for numbers with a decimal point, like .05, 2.4, -3.0 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we also learned about 2 basic data structures:\n",
    " 1. Lists: A list is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets [] and seperated by commas\n",
    " 2. Dicts: A dict is a collection of 'key:value' pairs enclosed in curly brackets {} seperated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `code` cell below make 1 example of each of these datatypes, you can check each example by pressing the play button after making each example. \n"

This allows us to demonstrate some really useful basic principles of python that apply to other datatypes, without giving people the excuse that they 'hate maths'. You can all write essays, which means you can all work with language. So let's work with language.\n",

    "\n",
    "The variable `m` that we assigned just above is a string which is 11 characters long. Each of those characters has a position within the string and this position is identified with a number. You might think that in `m` the position of the first character ('h') would be 1, but python is what's called a '0-indexed language', this means that we start counting positions from 0 instead of 1, this is demonstrated in the table below. \n",

    "\n",

Immediately after `m` we open square brackets `[` (like we used when we were making a list) then we put in the `index position` (represented by a number, look back up at the table above) and then we closed the square brackets `]`. This is the basic `syntax` for finding an object in a collection of objects. \n",

It's worth noting that we haven't acctually changed the list or string, when we say we've 'extracted' a part of them we don't mean that we have literally just pulled them out, we just mean we've selected those bits of information and given us a way to access them easily, but the original items are still intact, run the cell below to see.
