    "\n",
    "If we want to select specific columns, then we need to use a specific method called `iloc`. This method enables us to return rows for specified columns. Those specified columns are located (loc) by it's index position (i) amongst the columns, hence why it is called `iloc`. \n",

    "\n",
    "To orient you around the map, it will index one axis by letters('A', 'B'....'Z') and the other axis by numbers (1, 2,.....a gazillion). The combination of these two numbers, the co-ordinates, can then orient you to a specific place on the map. You can refer to the directory to find the specific building or location your looking for (e.g., \"Starbucks Coffee - B7\"). You know then that to find Starbucks on the map, you go to B on the letter axis (in this example, the rows) and then go to 7 on the number axis (in this example, the columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true for slicing our dataframe using iloc. Both our columns and dataframes will have indices, and we can use the co-ordinates to identify specific values. The only difference between this case and our map example, is that both the row and columns co-ordinates are numerical, starting at 0 and increasing. \n",
