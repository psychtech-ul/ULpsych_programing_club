It's the last thing to cover before we start working with data in `pandas`. Before we move onto that however, we want to take time to recap the more complex things that we've covered in the last few weeks, and to reinforce a couple of points that we've made in the last couple of weeks. \n",

    "Over the last few weeks you've been introduced to quite a lot of things, different `types` of `objects` (`ints`, `floats`, `strings`, `lists`, `dicts`), and you played around with a couple of different operations like `addition` and `concatenation`,  `multiplication` and `replication`, and you've learned how to pick `objects` appart using `indexing`. You've also learned how to give an object a short name that can be used to make it easier to work with, you've learned to `assign a variable`, and you've learned how to `call` a `function` to perform more complex operations on your objects. \n",

It's exactly like anyother language you've learned (and everyone in these sessions has learned at least one language).\n",
